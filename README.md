# Introduction

# Finding the two best markets to advertise in an E-learning product

In this project, I focus on identifying the two best markets to advertise an e-learning platform that offers programming courses. The platform primarily covers web and mobile development, but also includes topics like data science, game development, and other programming domains.

For this project, my goal is to answer questions such as:
* Where are new coders located?
* Which locations have the highest concentrations of new coders?
* How much are they willing to spend on learning?
* Which country or countries would be the best to spend money on an advertising campaign to generate new subscribers?

# Understanding the data

This analysis is based on FreeCodeCamp's 2017 `New Coder Survey`, which included responses from new coders with different interests, not just web development.

# Conclusion
In this project, I analyzed survey data from new coders to find the best two markets to advertise in. The only solid conclusion I could reach was that the US would be a good market to advertise in.

For the second best market, it wasn't clear-cut what to choose between India and Canada. Consulting with other departments like marketing (if exists) would be useful for handling a situation like this.
